Original content of SD card that came with printer

Config to be used with Cura 15.04.6 (setup details in the manual)

auto00-demoCAT.g is the test print cat they have in the SD

wifi_setup.g is the exception: not provided in the SD card but found online in order to setup WiFi on the printer (as the mobile apps do not exist anymore).  
*NOTE*: never managed to print anything by WiFi

Created bogus github release to host Cura 15.04.6 [here](https://github.com/fopina/mp-mini-delta-cura/releases/tag/cura-legacy)
